## My Phrase Structure Grammar

> this project arose from reading about grammars in my discrete math textbook. I was interested in the idea of creating my own phrase structure grammar.
> I'm not sure how this project will turn out, but it's worth a shot!

### Definitions
> A vocabulary (or alphabet) V is a finite, nonempty set of elements called symbols. A word
(or sentence) over V is a string of finite length of elements of V. The empty string or null
string, denoted by 𝜆 (and sometimes by 𝜖), is the string containing no symbols. The set of all
words over V is denoted by V∗. A language over V is a subset of V∗.
